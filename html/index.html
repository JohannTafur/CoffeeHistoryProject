        <h1>How Coffee arrived in Colombia</h1>
        <p>
            It all began centuries ago in Africa, Ethiopia, to be exact, where coffee was initially consumed in
            infusions or by chewing the leaves of the coffee plant, but it was the Arabians, who were responsible for
            its expansion, first throughout the Arab world arriving in Turkey in 1544. In the 17th century, coffee was
            introduced to Europe through the port of Venice, Italy and expanded across the continent to finally reach
            South America by the 18th century. Those responsible for this expansion across new continents were the Dutch
            who didnâ€™t want to have to depend on the Arabians. This is how, at the beginning of the 18th century, the
            Netherlands came to be the production leaders of the world. <br> <br>


            One of the theories about how coffee arrived in South America is that it was the Dutchmen who introduced it
            through what is known today as Suriname and then the French at the beginning of the 18th century, exported
            it to Colombia and Brazil. By the 19th century, it had become of great importance in farming which was also
            influenced by the fact that by the middle of 19th century, a disease known as coffee rust attacked the crops
            of Ceylon, Sri Lanka today, who at that time were the main coffee producers.

                <p>
                    The espresso, also known as a short black, is approximately 1 oz. of highly concentrated coffee.
                    Although simple in appearance, it can be difficult to master.
                    <br>
                    Ratio: 1 shot of espresso <br>
                    Cup: 2-4 oz. Espresso Cup

                    alt="Double Espresso">
                <p>
                    A double espresso may also be listed as doppio, which is the Italian word for double. This drink is
                    highly concentrated and strong. <br>

                    Ratio: 2 shots of espresso <br>
                    Cup: 3-4 oz. Demitasse Cup

                    alt="Red Eye">
                <p>
                    The red eye's purpose is to add a boost of caffeine to your standard cup of coffee.
                    <br>
                    Ratio: 1 shot of espresso + 6 oz. of drip-brewed coffeebr <br>
                    Cup: 8 oz. Coffee Mug

                <p>
                    The black eye is just the doubled version of the red eye and is very high in caffeine.
                    <br>
                    Ratio: 2 shots of espresso + 6 oz. of drip-brewed coffee <br>
                    Cup: 8-10 oz. Coffee Mug

                <h2>Americano</h2>
                <img src="https://cdnimg.webstaurantstore.com/uploads/blog/2019/4/coffee-drinks_americano.jpg"
                    alt="Americano">
                <p>
                    Americanos are popular breakfast drinks and thought to have originated during World War II. Soldiers
                    would add water to their coffee to extend their rations farther. The water dilutes the espresso
                    while still maintaining a high level of caffeine.
                    <br>
                    Ratio: 1 shot of espresso + 3 oz. of hot water <br>
                    Cup: 5-6 oz. Glass Coffee Mug
                </p>
            </li>

                    alt="Long Black">
                <p>
                    The long black is a similar coffee drink to the americano, but it originated in New Zealand and
                    Australia. It generally has more crema than an americano.
                    <br>
                    Ratio: 2 shots of espresso + 3 oz. of hot water <br>
                    Cup: 6-8 oz. Glass Coffee Mug
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Macchiato</h2>
                <img src="https://cdnimg.webstaurantstore.com/uploads/blog/2019/4/coffee-drinks_macchiato.jpg"
                    alt="Macchiato">
                <p>The word macchiato means mark or stain. This is in reference to the mark that steamed milk leaves on
                    the surface of the espresso as it is dashed into the drink. Flavoring syrups are often added to the
                    drink according to customer preference.
                    <br>
                    Ratio: 1 shot of espresso + 1 to 2 teaspoons of steamed milk <br>
                    Cup: 3 oz. Glass Espresso Cup
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Long Macchiato</h2>
                <img src="https://cdnimg.webstaurantstore.com/uploads/blog/2019/4/coffee-drinks_long-macchiato.jpg"
                    alt="Long Macchiato">
                <p>
                    Often confused with a standard macchiato, the long macchiato is a taller version and will usually be
                    identifiable by its distinct layers of coffee and steamed milk.
                    <br>
                    Ratio: 2 shots of espresso + 2 to 4 teaspoons of steamed milk <br>
                    Cup: 5 oz. Rocks Glass
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Cortado</h2>
                <img src="https://cdnimg.webstaurantstore.com/uploads/blog/2019/4/coffee-drinks_cortado.jpg"
                    alt="Cortado">
                <p>
                    The cortado takes the macchiato one step further by evenly balancing the espresso with warm milk in
                    order to reduce the acidity.
                    <br>
                    Ratio: 1 shot of espresso + 1 oz. of warm milk + 1 cm of foam <br>
                    Cup: 5 oz. Rocks Glass
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Breve</h2>
                <img src="https://cdnimg.webstaurantstore.com/uploads/blog/2019/4/coffee-drinks_breve.jpg" alt="Breve">
                <p>The breve provides a decadent twist on the average espresso, adding steamed half-and-half to create a
                    rich and creamy texture. <br>
                    <br>
                    Ratio: 1 shot of espresso + 3 oz. of steamed half-and-half + 1 cm of foam <br>
                    Cup: 5-7 oz. Low Cup
                </p>
