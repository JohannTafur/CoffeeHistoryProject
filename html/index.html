        <h1>How Coffee arrived in Colombia</h1>
        <p>
            It all began centuries ago in Africa, Ethiopia, to be exact, where coffee was initially consumed in
            infusions or by chewing the leaves of the coffee plant, but it was the Arabians, who were responsible for
            its expansion, first throughout the Arab world arriving in Turkey in 1544. In the 17th century, coffee was
            introduced to Europe through the port of Venice, Italy and expanded across the continent to finally reach
            South America by the 18th century. Those responsible for this expansion across new continents were the Dutch
            who didnâ€™t want to have to depend on the Arabians. This is how, at the beginning of the 18th century, the
            Netherlands came to be the production leaders of the world. <br> <br>


            One of the theories about how coffee arrived in South America is that it was the Dutchmen who introduced it
            through what is known today as Suriname and then the French at the beginning of the 18th century, exported
            it to Colombia and Brazil. By the 19th century, it had become of great importance in farming which was also
            influenced by the fact that by the middle of 19th century, a disease known as coffee rust attacked the crops
            of Ceylon, Sri Lanka today, who at that time were the main coffee producers.

        <h1>Brewing Styles</h1>
        <ul>
            <div>
                <li>
                    <h2>Drip Brew</h2>
                </li>

                <p>
                    Ground coffee is added to a brew basket and placed in an automatic coffee machine for this brewing
                    style. Gravity is used to pass water through the grounds, resulting in a traditional cup of coffee.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <li>
                    <h2>Pour Over</h2>
                </li>

                <p>
                    This brewing style is achieved by pouring boiling water slowly through coffee grounds as they sit in
                    a filter basket. The coffee then drips into a single cup, resulting in a potent brew.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <li>
                    <h2>Cold Brew</h2>
                </li>

                <p>
                    For cold brew, coarsely ground coffee is placed in room temperature water and allowed to steep for
                    an extended period of time. This results in a less bitter, highly caffeinated brew.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <li>
                    <h2>Espresso</h2>
                </li>

                <p>
                    To achieve an espresso brew, you'll need an espresso or cappuccino machine. These machines pass
                    pressurized hot water through a filter containing dark roasted finely ground coffee beans. The force
                    of the water produces a highly concentrated coffee shot. This is the method most commonly used for
                    the base of coffee drinks.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>

                    <h2>Ristretto</h2>
                </li>

                <p>
                    Brewed in a similar method to the espresso, pressurized water is passed through the coffee grounds.
                    However, you would use half the amount of water. The shorter brewing cycle creates a more
                    concentrated and darker shot of espresso.

                    The espresso, also known as a short black, is approximately 1 oz. of highly concentrated coffee.

                <p>
                    A double espresso may also be listed as doppio, which is the Italian word for double. This drink is
                    highly concentrated and strong. <br>

                <p>
                    The black eye is just the doubled version of the red eye and is very high in caffeine. <br>
                    <br>

                </li>

                <p>
                    Americanos are popular breakfast drinks and thought to have originated during World War II. Soldiers
                    would add water to their coffee to extend their rations farther. The water dilutes the espresso
                    while still maintaining a high level of caffeine. <br>
                    <br>
                    Ratio: 1 shot of espresso + 3 oz. of hot water <br>

                    <h2>Long Black</h2>
                </li>

                <p>
                    The long black is a similar coffee drink to the americano, but it originated in New Zealand and
                    Australia. It generally has more crema than an americano. <br>
                    <br>
                    Ratio: 2 shots of espresso + 3 oz. of hot water <br>

                    <h2>Macchiato</h2>
                </li>

                <p>The word macchiato means mark or stain. This is in reference to the mark that steamed milk leaves on
                    the surface of the espresso as it is dashed into the drink. Flavoring syrups are often added to the
                    drink according to customer preference. <br>
                    <br>
                    Ratio: 1 shot of espresso + 1 to 2 teaspoons of steamed milk <br>

                </li>

                <p>
                    Often confused with a standard macchiato, the long macchiato is a taller version and will usually be
                    identifiable by its distinct layers of coffee and steamed milk. <br>
                    <br>
                    Ratio: 2 shots of espresso + 2 to 4 teaspoons of steamed milk <br>

                <p>
                    The cortado takes the macchiato one step further by evenly balancing the espresso with warm milk in
                    order to reduce the acidity. <br>
                    <br>

                <p>
                    The breve provides a decadent twist on the average espresso, adding steamed half-and-half to create
                    a
                    rich and creamy texture. <br>

                <p>
                    This creamy coffee drink is usually consumed at breakfast time in Italy and is loved in the United
                    States as well. It is usually associated with indulgence and comfort because of its thick foam layer
                    and additional flavorings that can be added to it. <br>

                    flat white also originates from New Zealand and Australia and is very similar to a cappuccino but
                    lacks the foam layer and chocolate powder. To keep the drink creamy rather than frothy, steamed milk
                    from the bottom of the jug is used instead of from the top. <br>

                <p>
                    Cafe lattes are considered an introductory coffee drink since the acidity and bitterness of coffee
                    are cut by the amount of milk in the beverage. Flavoring syrups are often added to the latte for
                    those who enjoy sweeter drinks. <br>

                </li>

                <p>The mocha is considered a coffee and hot chocolate hybrid. The chocolate powder or syrup gives it a

                    There are a few variations on the Vienna, but one of the most common is made with two ingredients:
                    espresso and whipped cream. The whipped cream takes the place of milk and sugar to provide a creamy
                    texture. <br>

                    Affogatos are more for a dessert coffee than a drink you would find at a cafe, but they can add a
                    fun twist to your coffee menu. They are made by pouring a shot of espresso over a scoop of vanilla
                    ice cream to create a sweet after-meal treat. <br>
                    <br>
                    Ratio: 1-2 shots of espresso + 1 scoop of vanilla ice cream br
                    Cup: 5-7 oz. Dessert Dish <br> <br>

                <p>
                    The cafe au lait is typically made with French press coffee instead of an espresso shot to bring out
                    the different flavors in the coffee. It is then paired with scalded milk instead of steamed milk and
                    poured at a 50/50 ratio. <br>
                    <br>
                    Ratio: 5 oz. French press coffee + 5 oz. scalded milk <br>
                    Cup: 12 oz. Coffee Mug <br> <br>

                <p>
                    Iced coffees become very popular in the summertime in the United States. The recipes do have some
                    variance, with some locations choosing to interchange milk with water in the recipe. Often,
                    different flavoring syrups will be added per the preference of the customer. <br>
                    <br>
                    Ratio: 2 oz. drip coffee or espresso + 4 oz. of ice + 4-6 oz of milk or water + flavoring syrup to
                    taste <br>
